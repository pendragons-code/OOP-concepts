# OOP


## Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes based on an existing class

## Encapsulation
Hiding data from the outside world.

## Abstraction
Hiding the implementation details and only showing functionality to the user.

## Polymorphism
writing methods with the same name, but different implementation.

```
addNumbers(x, y) {
     return x + y;
}

addNumbers(x, y, z) {
    return x + y + z;
}
```
