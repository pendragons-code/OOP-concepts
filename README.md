# OOP

## My comments
Mastering OOP is important as it can really help you understand basic concepts across many languages. It also allows you to make use of these characteristics effectively in your future projects. However, you should also check out language specific guides on OOP since not all languages implement it the same way (e.g. the way python implements prototypal OOP is not the same as JS).

These are just condensed notes from these [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMIuwvt0vGQ&list=PL1BztTYDF-QOvKYBBYdjzHISCeaYCAEfH&index=1&pp=iAQB)<br><br> These are made by someone else, and you should check them out.

## Inheritance
Inheritance is a mechanism that allows us to create new classes based on an existing class

## Encapsulation
Hiding data from the outside world.

## Abstraction
Hiding the implementation details and only showing functionality to the user.

## Polymorphism
writing methods with the same name, but different implementation.

```
addNumbers(x, y) {
     return x + y;
}

addNumbers(x, y, z) {
    return x + y + z;
}
```
